# Introduction

Within starlette-core we set-up the base functionality of a [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) project.

This is intended to provide the core of a modular project and includes the implementation of a database, pagination and email functionaility which can then be utilised by additonal modules as the project expands.


## Getting Started - Installation

This package has not been published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org) so you will need to install it from the repo. To do this simply run:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/accent-starlette/starlette-core.git@master#egg=starlette-core

```

The minimum python requirement is 3.7.
