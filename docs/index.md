# Introduction

Within starlette-core we set-up the base functionality of a [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) project.

This provides the core of a modular project and includes the implementation of a database, pagination and email functionality which can then be utilised by additional modules as the project expands.


## Getting Started - Installation

This package has not been published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org) so you will need to install it from this [repo](https://github.com/accent-starlette/starlette-core). To do this simply run:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/accent-starlette/starlette-core.git@master#egg=starlette-core

```

The minimum Python requirement is 3.7.
